# Pokemon Vibe Check Tournament
Tommy D. Raatz

The goal of this website is to create a crowdsourced, uninformed, and incredibly biased ranking of pokemon based on vibes alone. The main page of the site displays a photo and name of two random pokemon and prompts the user to select which one "has better vibes," with what defines "better" and "vibes" purposefully left up to user's discretion.
